**PROJECT OVERVIEW** --
This project is a Personal Portfolio Webpage. The main goal of this project is to design and develop a clean, modern, and responsive portfolio website using HTML and CSS. This portfolio represents my personal profile as a frontend developer and showcases my skills, projects, and contact details in a professional way.
A personal portfolio website is very important for developers because it works as a digital resume. It allows recruiters, clients, and other developers to understand who you are, what skills you have, and what kind of projects you have worked on. This project focuses on building a strong foundation in frontend development by using semantic HTML structure and modern CSS styling techniques.

**🎯OBJECTIVES** --
The main objectives of this project are:
- To understand the basic structure of a real-world webpage using HTML
- To apply modern CSS for layout, styling, and responsiveness
- To create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface
- To practice Flexbox, hover effects, and responsive design
- To build a reusable portfolio layout that can be enhanced in the future

This project helped me improve my understanding of frontend fundamentals and best practices used in web development.

**🛠️TECHNOLOGY USED** --
The following technologies were used to build this portfolio webpage:
- HTML5 – For structuring the content of the webpage
- CSS3 – For styling, layout, animations, and responsiveness
- Google Fonts (Poppins) – For modern and clean typography

No external frameworks or libraries were used, which makes this project lightweight and easy to understand for beginners.

**📂WEBSITES SECTIONS** --
The portfolio webpage is divided into multiple well-structured sections: 

🔹 Navigation Bar --
   The navigation bar contains links to different sections of the webpage such as Home, Skills, Projects, and Contact. It uses a sticky position so that it stays visible while scrolling, providing better user        experience.

🔹 Hero Section -- 
   The hero section is the first thing users see when they open the website. It introduces me with my name and role as a frontend developer. A gradient text effect is applied to make the heading more attractive.

🔹 Skills Section --
   The skills section highlights my technical skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Responsive Design, and React Basics. Each skill is displayed inside a card with hover effects, which improves interactivity and     visual appeal.

🔹 Projects Section --
   The projects section showcases sample projects like a Portfolio Website, Landing Page, and Calculator App. Each project is displayed in a card layout with a title and short description.

🔹 Contact Section --
   This section provides my contact details including email address and phone number, making it easy for recruiters or clients to reach out to me.

🔹 Footer --
   The footer contains copyright information and gives the website a professional finish.

**📱RESPONSIVE DESIGN** --
The portfolio webpage is fully responsive and works well on different screen sizes such as desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Media queries are used to adjust layout, font sizes, and spacing for smaller screens. This ensures a smooth and consistent user experience across all devices.

**✨KEY FEATURES**
- Clean and modern UI design
- Dark theme for better visual comfort
- Responsive layout using Flexbox
- Hover effects for interactivity
- Sticky navigation bar
- Well-structured and reusable code

**🚀FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS**
In the future, this portfolio can be enhanced by adding:
- JavaScript animations and interactions
- A contact form with validation
- More real-world projects
- React-based version of the portfolio

This Task 3 Personal Portfolio Webpage helped me strengthen my frontend development skills and understand how real portfolio websites are structured. It is a beginner-friendly yet professional project that can be further expanded as I continue learning new technologies. This project reflects my dedication to learning web development and building clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.
